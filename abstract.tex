We study encoding arguments using partial prefix-free codes, which
allow us to prove probabilistic statements using the basic fact that
uniformly chosen elements from a set of size $n$ cannot be encoded
with fewer than $\log_2 n$ bits on average. This technique, in the
end, is a more direct version of the incompressibility method from the
study of Kolmogorov complexity. We use our technique to produce short
original proofs for several results. We also explore extensions of the
technique to non-uniform input distributions. Finally, we offer a new
manner of encoding which allows for real-valued codeword lengths,
thereby refining every other result obtained through encoding.
